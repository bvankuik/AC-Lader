# AC-Lader

App to view AC chargers. List of chargers is retrieved by downloading KML from

# To do

The following features are outstanding:
* Regularly poll and update KML from http://ac-laders.nl, then cache it
* Some chargers are not suitable for older Zoes. These should get mintgreen
  markers WITHOUT a dot. Figure out if the KML specifies this particular
  detail.
* Support Dynamic Type
