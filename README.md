# AC-Lader

App to view AC chargers. List of chargers is retrieved by downloading KML from
http://ac-laders.nl/

# To do

The following features need to be implemented:
* Add app icon
* Saving zoom
* Updating KML from http://ac-laders.nl
* Some chargers are not suitable for older Zoes. These should get mintgreen
  markers WITHOUT a dot. Figure out if the KML specifies this particular
  detail.
* Render HTML of placemark descriptions
* When tapping a cluster, zoom in
* When tapping a placemarker, offer to set a route in Apple Maps or Google Maps
  as per: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/guide
